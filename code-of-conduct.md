# Code of Conduct

FreeGeek staff and volunteers pledge to act in a respectful manner at all times while in and around the FreeGeek space, and whenever interacting with another FreeGeek volunteer or staff person during core hours.

FreeGeek is a diverse space, and we welcome a diversity of perspectives. All volunteers and staff should display common courtesy and sensitivity towards anyone who comes through FreeGeek's doors.

FreeGeek is strongly opposed to violence and to insure that each person that is involved with FreeGeek or that is in the FreeGeek space has a sense of security and can maintain their personal dignity, FreeGeek is committed to active nonviolence, in speech and action. FreeGeek staff and volunteers pledge to respectfully and peacefully revolve any disputes or disagreements.

FreeGeek is an information technology-oriented organization. Staff and volunteers pledge to refrain from any sexual language, innuendo or offensive remarks related to gender, sexual orientation, spiritual belief systems and religion, political views or ethnicity. Disparaging remarks about any group of people, unwanted sexual advances toward volunteers or staff, excessive cursing, cursing around children and other disruptive behaviors are unacceptable. These behaviors are unrelated to FreeGeek's goals and they can be completely alienating to other volunteers.

If two or more staff agree (unless only one staff person is on duty), any volunteer may be asked to leave the space for the remainder of any open day. If any staff member believes that more serious measures are required, the staff will meet and attempt to reach consensus on a course of action.
