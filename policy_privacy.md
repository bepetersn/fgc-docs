# Privacy Policy
> Proposed Feb 2013. Last changes approved at the [2013-03-17 Community Council Meeting](https://freegeekchicago.hackpad.com/vzsflZC2LbI).

FreeGeek Chicago is a non-profit organization that is dedicated to transparency in reporting all our activities to our members. We do not believe in the gathering of information that can be used to label or stereo-type a person; this is the collective value of FreeGeek Chicago. All information that is recorded by us is held in the strictest of confidence, and is limited to access by Staff members only.

## Record Keeping/Personal Information
We do not receive funding from the Federal government; therefore, we are not required to maintain information like: SSN#, age, race, gender, or religion of our members. Our Code of Conduct is one avenue that is used to maintain the safety of those within our community; when everyone is in compliance with the Code, then unacceptable conduct is not an issue. 

## Video Recording
Another avenue that is used to safeguard our community is video surveillance; this is not a consent to use your image in any way. The well being of our volunteers is paramount to the success of our program, and the equipment that is used and stored in our space is necessary for the sustainability of the community.

The recordings from the video surveillance will be maintained for one (1) week, then recorded over with the next week's activities. The only exception to this policy will be if an incident occurs that requires formal investigation, then the recording shall be maintained until the incident is resolved; at which point, it will be recorded over.
