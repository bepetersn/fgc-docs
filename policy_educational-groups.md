# Educational Group Policy
> Last changes approved at the [2013-03-17 Community Council Meeting](https://freegeekchicago.hackpad.com/vzsflZC2LbI).

From time to time, Freegeek Chicago is approached by organizations wishing to bring in groups to participate in the Earn-a-Box program. Here is a proposal for a standard response to such requests:

  - Request a formal Letter of Partnership declaring the organizationâ€™s intent to use Freegeek Chicago as their computer recycler in the future.
  - No more than 4 people in a group can participate in a Friday or Sunday OpenBuild.
  - All participants must attend our regularly scheduled Friday or Sunday orientation sessions before working on the floor.
  - Organizations that need to bring more than 4 participants at a time to Openbuild must be scheduled on a non-Openbuild day (ie. not an open Friday or Sunday); these PrivateBuild days must be approved by the Community Council and are subject to staff and volunteer availability.
