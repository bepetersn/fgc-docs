# Community Service Policy

FreeGeek Chicago encourages those seeking community service opportunities to volunteer with us. Unless your program prohibits it, hours served in FreeGeek volunteer programming will also count towards community service requirements. Volunteers that want to complete community service hours with FreeGeek must:

  - Before beginning, make FreeGeek Staff aware that they will be serving community service hours
  - Provide FreeGeek Staff with any required community service forms
  - Allow FreeGeek Staff up to one (1) week to process community service paperwork

Volunteers completing community service with restrictions on receiving any reward or benefit must complete their community service hours first, before earning hours in the FreeGeek OpenBuild program. These community service hours cannot count towards any FreeGeek Rewards.
